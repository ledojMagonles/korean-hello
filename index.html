        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>One night in a neighbourhood, our group of friends discovered our mutual love for Korean food during a casual dinner party. We talk about the tantalizing flavours of korean street foods, and it has ignited a shared passion within us. We decided to turn our love for Korean cuisine into something more than just shared dinners. We huddled around the dining table, brainstorming ideas and forming a plan.</p>
        <p>Our journey began humbly with a food stall at a local weekend market. With a modest but carefully curated menu of Korean favourites, we served hungry market-goers and people who love korean foods. Our mouthwatering dishes quickly gained a reputation, drawing crowds to our stall. Word spread like wildfire, and we soon had loyal customers. Our close bond helped us navigate the challenges of running a business. We celebrated the successes, learned from our mistakes, and made sure to keep our love for Korean cuisine at the heart of everything we did.</p>
        <p>As months passed, our popularity soared, and we decided to open a cozy little Korean eatery in the heart of the neighborhood. Our physical store was decorated with touches of Korean culture and provided a welcoming space for diners to enjoy Korean street foods. And now we have created this website for you to inquire about our business and our menu.</p>
